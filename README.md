# VBA-challenge
Assignment 2

## Overview ##

This project is designed to automate the analysis of quarterly stock data using VBA. 
The primary goal is to streamline the process of importing, processing, and analyzing stock data to generate insightful reports by
Creating a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

- The ticker symbol
- Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
- The total stock volume of the stock.
- To use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
- Add functionality to script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
- Made the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.

### Honourable Mentions ###
I had some help from my Classmate Natasha. She was able to identifying the error I had with my loop, which the original script did not 
calculate the data with the correct results. After identifying the issue. I browsed around Google, Stack Overflow and YouTube to learn how a 
loop code would normal work and how to utilise them properly for the purpose of my work. Here is a link (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52201947/appropriate-excel-vba-loop-function) 
to a Stack Overflow post that gave me basic understanding. Here is another link to a source I found while Googling for some more information 
on how to use Loop properly (https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/vba-for-loop-excel/#:~:text=In%20VBA%2C%20a%20For%20Loop,an%20end%20value%20is%20reached.)
And here is a link to a basic tutorial guide I came across that also did its magic for me (https://excelmacromastery.com/vba-tutorial-1/)
