# VBA-challenge
Assignment 2

I had some help with my Classmate Natasha for identifying the error I had with my loop which is why my original script did not calculate the data with the correct results.
After identifying the issue. I browsed around Google, Stack Overflow and YouTube to learn how a loop code would normal work and how to utilise them properly for the purpose of my work.
Here is a link (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52201947/appropriate-excel-vba-loop-function) to a Stack Overflow post that gave me basic understanding.
Here is another link to a source I found while Googling for some more information on how to use Loop properly (https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/vba-for-loop-excel/#:~:text=In%20VBA%2C%20a%20For%20Loop,an%20end%20value%20is%20reached.)
